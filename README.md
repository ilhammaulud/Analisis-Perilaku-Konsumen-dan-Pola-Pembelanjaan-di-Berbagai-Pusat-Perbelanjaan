## Problem Background
In todayâ€™s highly competitive retail environment, understanding customer behavior is key to designing effective business strategies. This dataset contains customer transaction records from multiple shopping malls, including attributes such as product categories, payment methods, age, and gender.

By analyzing this data, retailers can uncover shopping patterns, identify the most popular products, explore trends across different age and gender groups, and evaluate the effectiveness of shopping malls in boosting sales. Leveraging these insights enables businesses to develop targeted marketing strategies, manage inventory more efficiently, and enhance overall customer experience.

## Project Output
The outputs of this project include:

1. Descriptive Statistical Analysis

- Summarizes averages, medians, and distribution of customer spending across product categories, age, gender, payment methods, and shopping mall locations.

2. Inferential Statistical Analysis

- Conducts hypothesis testing (ANOVA) to compare average spending across gender and age groups, identifying statistically significant differences.

3. Business Insights & Report

- Provides a summary of findings in the form of actionable insights to support business decision-making.

## Data
The dataset comes from Kaggle under the name Customer Shopping Dataset, containing transaction data from shopping malls in Istanbul. It consists of 99,457 rows and 10 columns, covering both numerical and categorical features.

## Method
This project applies both Descriptive and Inferential Statistical Analysis to derive insights from customer transaction data.

## Stacks
The project is developed using Python (Pandas) with the following approaches:

1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploration and Analysis
3. Data Visualization
